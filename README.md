# bamazon

This Project uses NodeJS and MySQL. It is run within a console/terminal. For this reason, it can not be demonstrated with a live site, but rather the screenshots shown below, unless you choose to fork the repo and clone it to you local machine.

Bamazon is a small NodeJS application that lists a warehouse's inventory, prices and ID numbers. It allows you to place an order based on what is listed and then total the order up for you. You can then choose to place anotehr order.
